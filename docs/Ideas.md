this is vibe ai community where users can show their ai generated content..

as AI generation is becoming popular, people want to see how to do it and how explore what others are doing.. some people are interested to see how everyone are building.

1. on the home page, we should be showing all images, other content that the community is building and sharing. People can click on the content, give, learn more about that content download. when clicked, I am thinking user can see how they generated by model like google nano banana or grok image, prompt used to build, hashtags, etc, name. Each comes with heart and counter and keep track of all votes coming accross.. as people without accounts also can vote etc, comment as well.

2. Making it use-ful for users to upload their own contenet and categorzie to various sections from images to videos or any other you have as ideas. during upload we can give options of how this got generated, model, prompt, etc options as optonal. they can view their uploaded library track the comments, like like instagram feed.

3. various cateriogies like gif, videos, images, story books and otehr categories.. We need to select weekly top loved ones and it show on the leadersboard.

4. future use-case 2: all subscribers get free credits to generate images using multi-modals from google to grok.. where they can immediately generate, post -> when posted we can automate to capture the prompot, how it got generated with model etc... 

4. Future: Create an AI community of all subscribers to form a forum, learn and share about ai geneatyeion..


this is are few, but based on these... Do the best architecture, bestdatabase schema to scale... use open router, open ai from other projects as needed in future.

Also add your best ideas to it from what I have.. every feature on the UI should be functional.

thank you..
